## Narrative
Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?  

The artifact that I enhanced is from my CS-330 computational graphics and visualization course. The objective was to create a 3D representation of a 2D image using OpenGL.  The artifact was completed on March 1, 2024.  Using basic primitive shapes like cubes, cylinders, and planes, I was able to create my 3D Scene.  Some of the features include using the mouse to look around the scene and keyboard inputs for directions and zooming in and out.  I was also able to implement lighting, shading, and texture for a visual realistic effect. 

Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?  

Several reasons why I decided to include this artifact in my ePortfolio include the relations to software design and engineering and it was one of the most challenging assignments for me as well.  Specifically in the application class, I demonstrated my abilities and skills to use external libraries like OpenGL for rendering 3D models, created a software that sets up handling for user inputs using GLFW.  I also followed the industry’s best practices by creating maintainable, reliable, and reusable code and also clear documentation.  Overall, these skills reflect my abilities in software development.

Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?  

My objectives for this enhancement were to add more detailed texture to the objects to create a more realistic visual experience, as well as increase the camera speed for smoother and more responsive movements.  I was able to update the Dayquil object as well as the table, updated the camera speed, and lastly, I changed the way the textures are rendered so it can display any kind of textures with or without alpha channels.  As far as organization, I condensed the application by placing the objects in its own folder and was able to get rid of the disk object.
 
Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

While reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifacts I learned several things.  I learned why the textures weren't loading properly by reading more about image channels.  I had to make modifications to the alpha channels since textures would not load properly in the best-case scenario or break the program.  I learned after my code review that I didn’t need the disk object since I already modified the cylinder object.  So essentially, I learned code redundancy and got rid of codes I didn’t need.  I would say the biggest challenge during the enhancement was finding out why the program would work with certain textures and break with others.
