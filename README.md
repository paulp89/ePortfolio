## Artifacts

### 1. [Artifact 1 Name](https://github.com/paulp89/ePortfolio/blob/main/Original%20Artifacts/Artifact1.md)
  The artifact that I enhanced is from my CS-330 computational graphics and visualization course. The objective was to create a 3D representation of a 2D image using OpenGL.  The artifact was completed on March 1, 2024.  Using basic primitive shapes like cubes, cylinders, and planes, I was able to create my 3D Scene.  Some of the features include using the mouse to look around the scene and keyboard inputs for directions and zooming in and out.  I was also able to implement lighting, shading, and texture for a visual realistic effect.
