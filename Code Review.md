## Code Review

In this code review I am covering three artifacts that relates to each category of software design and engineering, algorithms and databases, and databases.  The artifacts will include my projects and assignments from the following courses, CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms, CS-330 computational graphics and visualization, CS-360 mobile architect and programming.  In my code review, I will be examining the various practices like coding structure, making sure that the code fully and correctly implements the design, coding standards and formatting. I will make sure each variable is correctly used with meaningful names, consistency, and watching out for redundant usage.  Using a checklist, I will also be looking at arithmetic operations, loops and branches, conditions, and more.  After the code reviews, I will also be discussing my plans to enhance the artifacts.
