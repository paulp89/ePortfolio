## Self-Assessment
While completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio, it has helped me showcase my strengths, shaped my professional goals and values, as well as prepared me to be more competitive and employable in the computer science field.   I have learned several new skills such as coding in different programming languages, like JavaScript, C++, Python, and more.  In classes such as, CS-320, CS-465, CS-340 and others, I have learned to develop and utilize various databases such as SQLite, MySQL, and MongoDB.  In my “other projects” directory I have uploaded an “Animal Shelters” project.  In this project, I utilize the MongoDB database, I have applied CRUD operations and developed user interfaces to interact with the data.  In my software development class, CS-320, through scenario assignments relating to software development, I learned different methods of software development.  I have learned and applied Agile methodology, which emphasizes reiterative dynamic development, collaboration, adaptability, and as well as working in a team-oriented environment with accepting constructive feedback.  In my software security class CS-305, I learned the importance of systematic testing to ensure software quality and functionality. By using Junit for testing, I validated features against customer requirements, such as enforcing unique contact IDs with specific constraints.  I’ve also developed a Single Page application using MEAN stack from static HTML pages.  Overall, I have gained technical skills and understanding in various areas of the computer science field.  By getting experiences in each, it has helped me narrow my career path goals by allowing me to find what I am most interested in, which is program management in the IT field.  After learning and growing with the program I began to understand the values of sacrifice, responsibility, commitment, collaborations and more.  I feel the program has tremendously helped me prepare for the computer science field.  

While in the computer science program, I have gained experience in various areas of the field. I have skills in collaborating in a team environment while working in software development. I’ve introduced different ideas and skill sets, leading to more innovative and well-rounded solutions. I’ve promoted team communication and knowledge sharing, allowing for quicker resolution and continuous learning and developing. I have made sure of accountability and ensured that tasks are distributed efficiently, helping to meet deadlines and maintain high-quality standards. Communicating with stakeholders is another crucial skill I have developed, ensuring that technical details are translated into clear, actionable information to align project goals with business objectives.  I make sure we get feedback from the stakeholders to keep developing our product for improvement.  I am always ready to annotate requests, demands, or feedback from stakeholders.   My skills in data structure and algorithms involve basic knowledge of database structures, that includes linked lists and hash tables.  Also implementing algorithms to manage tasks for data manipulation, optimization, and problem-solving.  I have skills in software engineering and databases as well, using MVC architecture for web applications and utilizing NoSQL databases.  Lastly in my security skills, I have implemented input validations and sanitization, authentication and authorization, secure communication, SHA data encryption, and more.

My portfolio is a continuous representation of my journey through the computer science program, showcasing a diverse range of technical skills and abilities. The artifacts within this portfolio are selected to illustrate my proficiency in software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each project highlights a specific area of expertise: the refined 3D model demonstrates my attention to detail and ability to enhance software design; the development of hash tables underlines my understanding of efficient data structures and algorithm optimization; and the inventory application created with Android Studio showcases my versatility in database management and mobile application development. Together, these artifacts form a unified narrative of my technical capabilities, problem-solving skills, and dedication to continuous improvement, making me well-rounded and an employable candidate in the field of computer science.
