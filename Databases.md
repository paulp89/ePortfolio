## Narrative
Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

The artifact that I enhanced is from my CS-360 mobile architect and programming course.  The artifact is an Android application assignment for managing inventory.  The objective was to create an inventory application using Android Studios.  My task included the development of authentication for user login, such as checking usernames and password against the database in case it already exists and allow new users to create login and save to the database.  I created a SQLite database to store inventory, user credentials, as well as perform CRUD operations.  Users can interface with the database through an interface with functionalities that include adding, removing, editing items in the inventory.  It also includes an SMS notification of low stocked inventory item.  

Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this item to include in my ePortfolio because it was a full stack application that I had to develop, and I felt fitted into the database category.  In the front-end development, a UI was designed with components for login forms, text fields, buttons, and more that interacts with the database to perform the functionalities.  On the back end I created a SQLite database that stores data such as, stores inventory items, user information, and event details.  I implemented a CRUD operation to perform backend tasks.  I was also able to integrate an SMS notification system into the application.  These are several skills I was able to showcase for my abilities in software development.  The application has improved by allowing users to add images to the items in the inventory.  This provides a better user experience by helping the users visually engage with the application and making it more user friendly.  This also showcases my abilities in software development in that it demonstrates my ability to integrate media such as images into the application.  

Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?  

In this enhancement I was able to meet the course objectives I planned to meet.  My objectives were to integrate the ability to add images to the shoe inventory items.  I was also able to upgrade the user interface to get rid of wasted space that the previous application had.  These enhancements give the user a better visual and engaging experience with the application.  
 
Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

 While developing the Android mobile application, I learned a few things.  I learned how to use Android studios, utilizing the tools and features to create and design the UI, I had to learn how to develop a database within the app, such as SQLite for storing, removing, and editing data.  I also learned how to interact with the UI functionalities with the database.  During the enhancement, I learned about Android's storage structure and how to access pictures with intent. With that, I learned how to integrate media such as images to the application to display with the shoe inventory details.  One of the challenges I faced was avoiding the use of deprecated methods for checking intent results and instead using Google's recommended way of doing it, it took me a little while to grasp it.
