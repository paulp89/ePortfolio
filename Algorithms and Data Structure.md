## Narrative
Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

The enhanced artifact is from my CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design course.  It was completed on September 24, 2023.  The objective was to develop a program to manage a collection of bids using a hash table and linked list. The program is structured to load and read bids from CSV files, insert them into a hash table, and provide functionalities such as loading bids, displaying all bids, finding specific bids by ID, and removing bids.  Lastly it provides a menu to execute these functionalities.

Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?

I specifically chose this artifact because of its relations to data structures and algorithms.  The main core of the artifact is the hash table, which performs the ability to implement and manage this data structure.  The hash function, insertion, search, and removal operations are important components that demonstrate an understanding of hash tables.  The artifact has improved in numerous ways after the enhancement.  The program can load both CSV files by typing in the file name, it is able to find specific bids per ID, it can now remove bids and restructure, and lastly the results clear after a selection and a result is given. 

Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

My objectives for this enhancement were to complete the program by adding the features it was made for.  The program was not able to load both csv files for the bid data, it wasn’t able to find bids, and it wasn’t able to remove bids.  Also, the console looked cluttered after making selections and displaying results.  I was able to enhance this program by modifying the codes of the needed functions, as well as the main function to clear the console between actions to avoid clutter and ensure a clean display.

Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

In the process of enhancing and modifying my artifact, I was able to reflect on a few things.  I learned how to implement exception handling in C++ to avoid user error breaking the program.  For example, the user selecting a file that doesn't exist or cannot be opened.  I learned to parse files and put them in a usable format.  For this program, the challenging part to me was deciding how to load the bids.  I wanted to allow the user to input their own file and search any bid which opens the program to more use cases and gives it actual usefulness.
